### ðŸ”¹ So, What is **DirectAccess Offline Domain Join**?

This is a **scenario** where **Offline Domain Join is used in conjunction with DirectAccess** to enable:

1. **Provisioning a new device remotely** (e.g., for a new employee working from home).
2. The device is shipped to the user **already configured** with:

   * Domain membership via ODJ.
   * DirectAccess client settings.
3. When the user powers on the system and connects to the internet, **DirectAccess automatically connects the device to the corporate network**.
4. The system can **receive Group Policies, software updates, and other IT management** â€” all without ever physically connecting to the corporate LAN.
